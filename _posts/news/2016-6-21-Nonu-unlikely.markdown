The All Blacks centurion, who joined Toulon after winning his second Rugby World Cup last year, has endured a mixed season but scored in the last weekend’s semi-final win over Montpellier.

However he also appeared to suffer a concussion during a collision attemping to make a tackle on Montpellier centre Anthony Tuitavake.

Nonu’s absense would mean that Mathieu Bastareaud comes into the midfield to partner Maxime Mermoz at the Nou Camp.
